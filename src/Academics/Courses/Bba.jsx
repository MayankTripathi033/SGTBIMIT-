          <h1>Bachelors of Business Administration</h1>
          <p>
            The Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University-affiliated Sri Guru Teg Bahadur
            Institute of management and information technology (SGTBIMIT) provides a 3-year
            full-time bachelor's degree in business administration (BBA). This is planned
            and organised to give young brains a learning atmosphere that is intellectually
            challenging. Students who complete the course will have a fundamental understanding
            of both international business and management ideas. The aim of this program at
            SGTBITMIT is to create outstanding professionals who can use theory in the workplace
            and are able to recognize and resolve management issues on both a local and global
            scale. The method of instruction is more pragmatic, and knowledge is transferred for
            use in the business sector.
            With a focus on industrial exposure, this undergraduate curriculum gives students a
            broad understanding of management theory. The curriculum for the course was created
            following a thorough analysis of the needs of all stakeholders and the constantly
            shifting requirements of the sector. The key components of the programme place a
            focus on developing students' soft skills and maximising the interface with industry
            through a variety of initiatives. Using a credit-based system, the curriculum also
            provides enormous flexibility and learning opportunities. SGTBIMIT adheres to GGSIPU
            guidelines for exam administration and result announcement, both of which are entirely
            at the university's discretion.
            Lectures, case studies, role-plays, and integrative exercises are all included in the
            adaptable curriculum. The goal of BBA instruction is to help students develop their
            problem-solving skills in relation to various business-related issues. Students are
            given a platform to familiarise themselves with the rapidly evolving global business environment.
